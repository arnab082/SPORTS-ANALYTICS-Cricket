# Sports Analytics - Cricket

The game of Cricket involves the
emotions of an enormous number of fans and followers of the sport. Sometimes, due
to impulse, some fans tend to criticize players badly but donâ€™t mention or consider
the impact caused by the statistics or records made by 3 those players in the past.
Hence, we as students of Computer Science, having some knowledge about
statistical analysis tend to compare and marginalize players based on their data on
past records. As a result we hope to find a conclusion and put behind some points to
analyze the reason behind the bad performance or the good performance of the
player. This will enable us to get an insight about the weak points of the player and
thereby leading to a proper prescriptive analysis.
